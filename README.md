## Note: This set of React sample got four different files. All following buckyroberts (thenewboston) React for Beginners Tutorials from 1 to 7. I have combined the 7 tutorials into separate 4 parts in this project. Each part is named as different boilerplates. Test out each 'boilerplates' and each the result in your localhost environment via Chrome. I use WebStorm for these tutorials, but you can choose to use any other code editor to run it.

## Getting started

To get started simply download the repo using the link below. All required files are included.

The main index.html is in the demos folder. Inside the demos there are4 boiler plates. Click on the index.html in each of them and open on web browser to display it.

## Setting up Gulp (optional)

You can also use Gulp to add additional build tasks. To use, follow the instructions below.

Navigate to the root directory and  run the following command:
```
> npm install
```

After modules are installed, you can start watching for SCSS changes using the command:
```
> gulp
```

You can install more modules and configure them in the **gulpfile.js** file as needed.
